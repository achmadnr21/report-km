The denominator degrees of freedom are based on the error term, which measures the within-group variability.\n",

    "- Hotelling-Lawley trace: It measures the effect of the \"Species\" groups in the multivariate space.\n",
    "- Roy's greatest root: This is the strongest effect of the \"Species\" groups in the univariate space.\n",
    "For each measure (Wilks' lambda, Pillai's trace, Hotelling-Lawley trace, and Roy's greatest root), there is a corresponding \"Value\" column that shows the value of the measure. Additionally, there are \"Num DF\" (numerator degrees of freedom) and \"Den DF\" (denominator degrees of freedom) columns, which indicate the degrees of freedom associated with the F-distribution used to test the significance of the effects or differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"F Value\" column displays the calculated F-statistic value used to test the significance of the effects or differences. The \"Pr > F\" column indicates the p-value or the probability of association between the effects or differences and the variable \"Species\". In this case, all the \"Pr > F\" values are 0 (or very close to 0), which suggests significant differences between the \"Species\" groups in the multivariate response variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the MANOVA results conclude that the variable \"Species\" significantly affects the multivariate response variables, which include \"Sepal_Length\", \"Sepal_Width\", \"Petal_Length\", and \"Petal_Width\"."
