If you deviate from this, your model may not be recognized by the grader and may fail.\n","\n","We included a few hints to use the Sequential API below but feel free to remove it and use the Functional API just like in the ungraded labs if you're more comfortable with it. Another reason to use the latter is if you want to visualize the encoder output. As shown in the ungraded labs, it will be easier to indicate multiple outputs with the Functional API. That is not required for this assignment though so you can just stack layers sequentially if you want a simpler solution."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"Wr-Bok3lRgA3"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Model: \"sequential\"\n","_________________________________________________________________\n"," Layer (type)                Output Shape              Param #   \n","=================================================================\n"," conv2d (Conv2D)             (None, 32, 32, 32)        896       \n","                                                                 \n"," batch_normalization (BatchN  (None, 32, 32, 32)       128       \n"," ormalization)                                                   \n","                                                                 \n"," conv2d_1 (Conv2D)           (None, 16, 16, 32)        9248      \n","                                                                 \n"," conv2d_2 (Conv2D)           (None, 16, 16, 32)        9248      \n","                                                                 \n"," batch_normalization_1 (Batc  (None, 16, 16, 32)       128       \n"," hNormalization)                                                 \n","                                                                 \n"," up_sampling2d (UpSampling2D  (None, 32, 32, 32)       0         \n"," )                                                               \n","                                                                 \n"," conv2d_3 (Conv2D)           (None, 32, 32, 32)        9248      \n","                                                                 \n"," batch_normalization_2 (Batc  (None, 32, 32, 32)       128       \n"," hNormalization)                                                 \n","                                                                 \n"," conv2d_4 (Conv2D)           (None, 32, 32, 3)         99        \n","                                                                 \n","=================================================================\n","Total params: 29,123\n","Trainable params: 28,931\n","Non-trainable params: 192\n","_________________________________________________________________\n"]}],"source":["# suggested layers to use. feel free to add or remove as you see fit.\n","from keras.layers import Conv2D, UpSampling2D\n","\n","# use the Sequential API (you can remove if you want to use the Functional API)\n","model = Sequential()\n","\n","### START CODE HERE ###\n","# use `model.add()` to add layers (if using the Sequential API)\n","model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=3, strides=1, padding='same', activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)))\n","model.add(tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization())\n","model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=3, strides=2, padding='same', activation='relu'))\n","model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=3, strides=1, padding='same', activation='relu'))\n","model.add(tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization())\n","model.add(UpSampling2D())\n","model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=3, strides=1, padding='same', activation='relu'))\n","model.add(tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization())\n","model.add(Conv2D(3,  kernel_size=1, strides=1, padding='same', activation='sigmoid'))\n","\n","### END CODE HERE ###\n","\n","model.summary()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jRWTAijKEVUC"},"source":["## Configure training parameters\n","\n","We have already provided the optimizer, metrics, and loss in the code below."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"id":"iHIeD9eDETSk"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Please do not change the model.compile() parameters\n","model.compile(optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'], loss='mean_squared_error')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tLQPhm1W_8dC"},"source":["## Training\n","\n","You can now use [model.fit()](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#fit-method) to train your model.
